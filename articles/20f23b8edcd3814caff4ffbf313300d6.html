        <p>Demis Hassabis highlighted how AI could transform drug discovery, potentially reducing development timelines from a decade to just months or even weeks. Building on DeepMind's AlphaFold work, their spinout company Isomorphic Labs is rethinking drug discovery from first principles with AI. The traditional drug development process is laborious, hard, painstaking, and expensive, typically taking around ten years from identifying a disease cause to delivering a cure to patients. Hassabis compared this potential transformation to how protein structure prediction went from taking years with experimental techniques to seconds with computational methods like AlphaFold. AI can accelerate the discovery phase by quickly identifying targets and compounds, detecting toxicity earlier, and analyzing data faster.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_EWijTx9o</p>
