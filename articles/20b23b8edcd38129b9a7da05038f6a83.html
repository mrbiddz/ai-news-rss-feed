        <p>Builder AI, a company valued at $1.5 billion that raised over $450 million from investors including Microsoft, Qatar Investment, and SoftBank, was caught faking its AI capabilities. Instead of using AI as claimed, the company relied on around 700 human engineers in India who manually wrote code for client projects. Additionally, Builder AI engaged in fraudulent business practices, including 'roundtripping' with Verse Innovation where they billed each other for roughly the same amounts between 2021 and 2024 to inflate revenue figures presented to investors. The company's creditors eventually seized their accounts, leading Builder AI to file for bankruptcy.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0InTgNln8w</p>
