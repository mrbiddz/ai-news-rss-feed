        <p>MidJourney has released their first video model called V1. This is an image-to-video model where users first create an image with MidJourney and then animate it. The model maintains MidJourney's distinctive aesthetic in video form. Users can select from four animation variations and can extend videos either automatically or manually with additional prompts. The model can also animate uploaded real photos, such as turning a still image of a person into a dancing video. The explore page showcases impressive realistic videos as well as fantastical creations.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnlZKV-ZJQ</p>
