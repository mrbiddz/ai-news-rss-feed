        <p>According to Sam Altman on his brother Jack Altman's podcast, Meta has been trying to poach OpenAI employees with signing bonuses of $100 million or more. Altman claimed that Meta sees OpenAI as their biggest competition, as tools like ChatGPT are taking attention away from Meta's platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Altman stated that so far none of OpenAI's 'best people' have accepted these offers.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnlZKV-ZJQ</p>
