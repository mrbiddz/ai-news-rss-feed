        <p>11 Labs released their SB1 Infinite Soundboard, a combination soundboard, drum machine, and ambient noise generator. Users can describe sound effects they want to hear, and the system generates them using 11 Labs' text-to-sound-effects model. The free tool includes preset sound effects like thunder, cricket sounds, and waves, as well as drum machine capabilities that can be mapped to a keyboard. Separately, Stability AI and ARM collaborated to release Stable Audio Small, an open-source audio generator small enough to run on mobile phones. While it can only create 12 seconds of audio at a time, the model's weights and code have been made publicly available on Hugging Face and GitHub for anyone to use and build upon.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZXToaZwGaw</p>
