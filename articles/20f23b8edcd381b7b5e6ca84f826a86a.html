        <p>Demis Hassabis predicted that AI agents capable of handling a week's worth of work might be only about a year away. These agents could offload mundane administrative tasks and enhance experiences like planning trips. He mentioned that the biggest bottleneck currently is the reliability of reasoning processes and tool use. Even a small 1% error rate can compound significantly over 50-100 steps, and many interesting tasks require multi-step planning and action. Projects like Mariner are working toward this goal, but improvements in reliability are still needed before AI agents can consistently execute complex, multi-step tasks.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_EWijTx9o</p>
