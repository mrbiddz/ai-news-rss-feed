        <p>AI is set to transform advertising across platforms. Mark Zuckerberg outlined his vision for how advertising will work on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where businesses will simply provide their objectives and budget, and AI will handle everything from creative development to targeting and optimization. Meanwhile, Netflix is using generative AI to create ad formats that blend with their shows, making ad breaks look less like interruptions by incorporating Netflix IP into the background of ads. YouTube is also implementing AI with 'Peak Points,' a new product built with Gemini that identifies the most engaging moments within videos to place ads where audiences are most invested. Additionally, Pika released a provocative ad showing a person using their AI tool to transform their surroundings into fantastical scenes while ignoring a post-apocalyptic reality outside their window.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZXToaZwGaw</p>
