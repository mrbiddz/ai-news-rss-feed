        <p>OpenAI acquired Jony Ive's company LoveFrom to develop a physical AI device. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products like the iPod and iPhone, is working with OpenAI on what's rumored to be a pocket-sized, screen-free, contextually aware device that isn't eyewear. Sam Altman suggested the acquisition could increase OpenAI's value by $1 trillion and envisions a family of devices. Some rumors claim it might have an iPod shuffle form factor or be an AI necklace, but details remain tightly under wraps.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ5hXOxWDKA</p>
