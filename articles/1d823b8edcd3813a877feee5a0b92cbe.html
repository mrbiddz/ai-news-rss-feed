        <p>Meta released Llama 4, which includes three models. Two are available now: Llama 4 Scout with a 10 million token context window (equivalent to about 94 novels) and Llama 4 Maverick with a 1 million token context window but more parameters. A third model, Llama 4 Behemoth, is coming soon and will be trained on two trillion parameters, potentially making it the largest known model. Meta is calling these 'open-source' models, though there are restrictions that technically disqualify them from being truly open source. According to benchmarks, Llama 4 Scout achieved 100% accuracy in needle-in-a-haystack tests. However, controversy erupted when an anonymous whistleblower claimed Meta trained on benchmark test data to artificially inflate performance metrics, which Meta denied. Further controversy arose when LM Arena revealed that the Llama 4 model Meta submitted to their leaderboard was a customized version optimized for human preference, different from the publicly released model.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usjPCQAoF44</p>
