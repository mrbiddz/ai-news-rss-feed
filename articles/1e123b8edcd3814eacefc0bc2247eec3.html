        <p>The Academy of Motion Pictures (Oscars) has announced that they don't object to the use of AI in films. Their statement indicates that AI tools 'neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination' and that they will judge achievements based on 'the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship.' While fully AI-generated movies are unlikely to win awards soon, the Academy appears open to films that incorporate AI elements.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRqo_1ywGx8</p>
