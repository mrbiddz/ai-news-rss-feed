        <p>When asked about building public trust, Hassabis emphasized that DeepMind tries to be a responsible role model with frontier technologies. Their approach includes demonstrating AI's positive applications in medicine, biology, climate, and energy. He stressed that companies must behave thoughtfully and responsibly with powerful technology. On privacy concerns, Hassabis stated that Google takes privacy extremely seriously, and features discussed with assistants would require clear opt-in from users with full transparency. His vision is for AI assistants to feel like they're working for the individual user - 'your personal AI' working on your behalf.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_EWijTx9o</p>
