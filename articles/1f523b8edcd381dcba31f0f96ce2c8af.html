        <p>Researchers from Singa University, Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, and Penn State have developed a new method called 'Absolute Zero' for training AI models without external data. This approach addresses concerns about how super-intelligent AI systems could continue learning when human-provided tasks become too limited. The Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) self-evolves its training curriculum by proposing its own tasks, attempting to solve them, and using a code executor to verify answers. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves state-of-the-art performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing models that rely on human-curated examples. However, this approach is currently limited to math and coding problems and wouldn't work for general knowledge domains like business advice, history, or current events.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZXToaZwGaw</p>
