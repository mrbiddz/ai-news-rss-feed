        <p>Regarding Android XR glasses with cameras and microphones, Hassabis addressed privacy concerns by emphasizing the importance of making it obvious when devices are on or off through user interfaces and form factors. He acknowledged that society needs to develop agreements and norms about how these devices should be used if they become popular and useful.
