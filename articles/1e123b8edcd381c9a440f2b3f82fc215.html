        <p>Microsoft is finally rolling out its Recall feature for Windows, which functions like a browser history for your entire computer. Users can go back and see what they were doing in various applications and even use AI prompts to find specific times and activities. After addressing privacy concerns, Microsoft has made Recall an opt-in experience rather than being on by default. The feature includes controls and filters to set what gets saved, and all data is processed locally on the device without being sent to the cloud or shared with Microsoft.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRqo_1ywGx8</p>
