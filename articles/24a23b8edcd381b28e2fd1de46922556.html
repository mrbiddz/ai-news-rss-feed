        <p>11 Labs has released a new feature that allows users to generate music, competing with services like Suno and Udio. The tool can generate full songs with vocals as well as instrumental tracks without vocals. Users can specify styles, instruments to include or exclude, and even the musical key. The feature is particularly useful for musicians who want to create backing tracks to jam over. While the vocal quality may not yet match competitors like Suno, the tool provides real-time generation that users can watch as it creates the music.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17HXdNYti0</p>
