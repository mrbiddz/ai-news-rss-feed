        <p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, explained how large language models (LLMs) function under the hood. He described that at a basic level, these systems are trying to predict the next word by looking at vast training sets of language. The goal is not just to regurgitate what they've seen but to generalize to novel queries. Modern chatbots are question-response machines fine-tuned to be assistants. DeepMind recently announced 'Deep Think,' which tops benchmarks for coding and math by implementing a third part of training called 'inference time training' or 'thinking,' where the model reviews its answer before outputting it to users. This approach includes parallel thoughts and choosing the best response, similar to techniques pioneered with AlphaGo nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_EWijTx9o</p>
