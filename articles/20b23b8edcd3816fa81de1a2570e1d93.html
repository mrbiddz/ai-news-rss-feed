        <p>Phonely announced an AI agent that can make phone calls with 99% accuracy, claiming customers can't tell they're not speaking with a human. The company partnered with Matai and Grock to speed up response times, making conversations sound more natural. While this technology could be useful for tasks like scheduling appointments, there are concerns about not knowing whether you're speaking to a human or AI, as well as potential scam applications.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0InTgNln8w</p>
