        <p>OpenAI has released Chat GPT5, their newest and most state-of-the-art model that outperforms all previous benchmarks. GPT-5 demonstrates EHD level intelligence across topics, scoring 100% on math benchmarks when using tools. It's faster, better at coding and writing, hallucinates less, and is less likely to deceive users. The interface has been simplified, removing the confusing model selection dropdown and automatically determining how to approach each prompt. GPT-5 is available to all users (free, Plus, Pro, and Team), with Enterprise and EDU customers getting access within a week. The model includes customizable personalities with four initial options: cynic, robot, listener, and nerd. It's also immediately available for developers via API, allowing integration with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, and Bolt.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17HXdNYti0</p>
