        <p>Elon Musk has announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Grock 5 will be released before the end of the year and will be "crushingly good." The announcement came on the same day as OpenAI's GPT-5 launch. This is notable considering Grock 4 was only released about a month ago, though based on Musk's track record with timelines, there's speculation about whether Grock 5 will actually be released within the stated timeframe.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17HXdNYti0</p>
