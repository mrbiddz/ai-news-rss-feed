        <p>Demis Hassabis shared his vision for AI's future role in enhancing mental wellbeing. He expressed excitement about AI for science work, noting that tools like AlphaFold have become standard in biology and medical research with over 2 million researchers using it worldwide. Looking forward, he envisions AI systems that enrich life and protect users' mental space from digital bombardment. Hassabis suggested that digital assistants could work on behalf of users, surfacing information only when wanted rather than constantly interrupting. This technology could help people filter out negativity and toxicity from social media, allowing them to focus on meaningful activities like travel, hobbies, and time with loved ones.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_EWijTx9o</p>
