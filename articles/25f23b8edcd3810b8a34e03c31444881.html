        <p>YouTube has been testing a feature that uses machine learning to automatically enhance uploaded videos by unblurring, denoising, and improving clarity. This was done without creators' knowledge, leading to complaints when viewers thought the videos were AI-generated. The issue gained attention after a Will Smith video appeared to have AI-generated crowds, though the footage was real but enhanced by AI. YouTube plans to add an opt-out option for this feature but hasn't rolled it out yet.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPiopAtoho4</p>
