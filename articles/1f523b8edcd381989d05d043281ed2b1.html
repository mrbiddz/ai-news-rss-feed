        <p>Alpha Evolve from Google DeepMind is a self-improving AI that evolves code rather than just writing it. It uses two of Google's models: Gemini Flash to maximize the breadth of ideas explored, and Gemini Pro to provide critical depth with insightful suggestions. Alpha Evolve verifies, runs, and scores proposed programs using automated evaluation metrics. Google DeepMind has been using Alpha Evolve internally to optimize their data center, TPU circuit design, and even to train Gemini models. It has discovered multiple new algorithms for matrix multiplication, including an algorithm to multiply 4x4 complex valued matrices that improves on the previous best algorithm from 1969. What makes Alpha Evolve particularly special is that it's inventing new methods of solving problems rather than just using methods already known and scraped from the internet.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZXToaZwGaw</p>
