        <p>OpenAI is facing controversy over its acquisition of Jony Ive's company IO. Sam Altman and Jony Ive previously met with another company called I/O (spelled with a Y) that was developing an AI-powered earbud with cameras. After declining to acquire that company, OpenAI later acquired Jony Ive's company IO (spelled without a Y) and announced plans to make hardware together. The original company is now suing OpenAI, claiming they stole concepts, while OpenAI disputes this, saying they're not building a wearable device.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr-4jDdS0LY</p>
