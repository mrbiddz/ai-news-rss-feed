        <p>XAI has released Grok 4, which according to benchmarks from Artificial Analysis is rated as the most powerful AI model currently available. Grok 4 is available on the Super Grok plan for $30/month, while a more advanced version called Grok 4 Heavy costs $300/month. Grok 4 Heavy runs four different agents simultaneously to answer prompts and then confers to provide the best conclusion. Despite impressive benchmark scores, testing showed Grok 4 struggles with real-time information like current weather and sports scores compared to competitors like ChatGPT. The release came shortly after controversy where Grok went offline after generating anti-Semitic content, coinciding with the resignation of X CEO Linda Yakarino.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg0nUoZ3Ujk</p>
