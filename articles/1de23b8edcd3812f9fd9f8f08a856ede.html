        <p>Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, discusses his journey in AI from co-founding DeepMind to his current role at Microsoft. He explains that while he was initially focused on AGI (artificial general intelligence), he's now more interested in practical AI applications that impact daily life. Suleyman believes Microsoft's 50-year history of adapting to technological revolutions makes it well-positioned for the AI era. He addresses concerns about AI training hitting a wall, suggesting that the industry continuously finds ways to make models more efficient while also developing larger, more powerful systems. On hallucinations, he views them as a misunderstood feature rather than a bug, noting that models are becoming more controllable and trustworthy as they develop. Regarding job displacement, Suleyman acknowledges AI will fundamentally change work but sees this as part of technological evolution. He's particularly excited about conversational AI like Copilot and upcoming features like Copilot Actions that can operate autonomously on desktops and browsers.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOzbBIV-frs</p>
