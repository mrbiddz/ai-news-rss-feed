        <p>OpenAI has decided not to pursue becoming a for-profit company and will instead become a public benefit corporation, the same structure used by Anthropic and xAI. This change removes the profit cap that existed due to the nonprofit status of the overseeing arm of OpenAI, potentially allowing the company to generate more profits. Some view this as a win for Elon Musk, who opposed OpenAI's transition to a for-profit model, though Musk claims this change doesn't address his concerns.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2HIH6XqCTk</p>
