        <p>Quinn Image has been released and is being claimed by many as the best image generation model currently available. It excels at creating both text and images, handling realistic images and cartoon styles with equal proficiency. The model is accessible at chat.quinn.ai and allows users to generate images without even needing to log in initially. Quinn Image particularly stands out for its text rendering capabilities, which represents significant progress compared to image models from a year and a half ago.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17HXdNYti0</p>
