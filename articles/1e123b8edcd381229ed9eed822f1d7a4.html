        <p>Anthropic published several articles about AI safety this week. In 'Our Approach to Understanding and Addressing AI Harms,' they argue that AI companies need to focus on more than just doomsday scenarios, looking at physical, psychological, economic, societal, and individual autonomy impacts. They've tweaked Claude 3.7 to refuse 45% fewer harmless prompts while maintaining guardrails on dangerous content. In another article, 'Detecting and Countering Malicious Uses of Claude,' they shared case studies of malicious uses like political bot farms, password scouting, and malware coding. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also published an essay called 'The Urgency of Interpretability,' emphasizing the need to better understand how AI models think.</p><p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRqo_1ywGx8</p>
